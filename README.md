### General requirements
  - I make sure that there are no linter errors:
  - Linter should be set up correctly for this repository.
  - Linter result should be green.
  - There should be no custom changes to linter config.
  - I make sure that I used correct GitHub Flow:
    - README file should be descriptive.
    - Commit messages should be meaningful.
    - Pull Request should have a descriptive title explaining what changes are inside.
    - Pull Request should have a short summary describing introduced changes in more detail.
    - I make sure that I documented my work in a professional way:
    - Branch name should describe a feature or action (e.g. 'created_sidebar' or 'added_comments_section').
    - Pull Request is made from 'feature branch' into the main branch.

### HTML/CSS requirements
  - Follow best practices for HTML & CSS.


### Project requirements
  - For this project, I should use the HTML&CSS linter
  - The 2 sections I need to build for this project are:
    - the toolbar (or header):
      - Toolbar
    - the headline section (right after the header):
    - In order to lay out the elements on the page I should use Flexbox in all 2 sections.
    - I don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.
    - I must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, text, margins) using the template 2 in Figma.
    - Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
